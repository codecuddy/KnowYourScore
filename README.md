# KnowYourScore

You’re invited to workshop at the Microsoft Technology Center that will help you to easily establish a cloud governance and compliance program. As an output of this workshop, you'll receive a compliance score that measures your current public cloud environment and the cost and security risks it poses. This score will give you insight into immediate steps you can take to secure your cloud within days, rather than months.

With the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure as the base of your future compliance program, you'll learn how to leverage industry best-practices and specific learnings that include:

A point-in-time compliance analysis of your cloud environment benchmarked against the CIS framework
A snapshot of the attendee’s current baseline in their environment with the ability to customize drift detection around cost, security, and compliance
A governance and compliance MVP with a process in place to create or mature a Cloud Center of Excellence
Don't let the public cloud slow you down. We hope to see you there!

Once you've registered, we'll provide you with instructions to come prepared to best leverage this session
